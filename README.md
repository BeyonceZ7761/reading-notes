## Markdown

 * What is Markdown?
 Is a Lightwight markup lauaguage that you can use to add forrmatting elemnts to plaintext doucments
  
* Why  Do we use Markdown?
-Writing tool that keeps documentation formatting breeze,but moves us technical writes closter to develops because it allows us to specka and also write in the same language 

* What symbol will create heading in Markdown?
- Using hash (#) sign One way is to add a hash # sign and space, followed by a heading string, Hash symbol count represents the subheading types

* How many do you need to create the largest heading?
- Correct HTML tag for the largest heading is <h1>. In an HTML page, the <h1> to <h6> tags are used to define headers. HTML header tags distinguish a page's headers (h1) and sub-headings (h2-h6) from the rest of the content.

* How many do you need to create the smallest heading?
* - <h6> Heading tags are used to define headings or subheadings on a web page. There are six levels of heading tags, ranging from <h1> (the largest) to <h6> (the smallest)

* When making text bold or italicized for emphasis, it is best practice to use which symbol?
 - Bold text, sometimes referred to as emphasized text, should only be used to convey information labels and should always be paired with a colon (:)
 - Italic text is not used on the University of Maine System website except for in the Content Management training to highlight examples of correct and incorrect usage of words, spelling and terms and on some data tables. Do not italicize words on the System website for general content.
-Depends on the context. In advertising, you’d perhaps bold sections of text to make them stand out, or if they appear as subheadings. In fiction, the only time I’ve seen bolded text is in chapter headers or section breaks, if that. Hardly, if ever in the body of the story.

* How do you create a link with Markdown?
 -You can create a link by first putting link description text in Brackets [ ] then after that wrap URL in the parentheses()
 
* What are the three symbols you can use to create an unordered (bulleted) list with Markdown?
 - Bullet point lists can be created by starting each line with an asterisk followed by a space before the content of the bullet point. Note that the space is important and should not be forgotten.
