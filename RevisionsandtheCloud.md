1. What is Version Control?
- Version control, also known as versioning or source control, is the practice of managing changes to source code.
 It’s about keeping a detailed account of every modification made to the code, ensuring that these changes are both trackable and reversible. A crucial tool in every developer’s kit, version control systems are the bedrock of this process.
Version control plays an integral role in both software development and project management. The tracking and versioning of source code changes in the repository form the heart of this process.
three key reasons why version control is important to both software developers and product/project managers:
- Streamlined release management
- Confliction prevention
- Tracking changes to digital artifacts
2. What is cloning in Git?
-When you clone a repository, you copy the repository from GitHub.com to your local machine. You can clone a repository from GitHub.com to your local computer to make it easier to fix merge conflicts, add or remove files, and push larger commits.

3. What is the command to track and stage files?
   - The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git.
   -3 main types of file tracking systems: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), file tracking software & record management companies.

4. What is the command to take a snapshot of your changed files?
The git diff command helps you see, compare, and understand changes in your project. You can use it in many different situations, e.g. to look at current changes in your working copy, past changes in commits, or even to compare branches

5. What is the command to send your changed files to Github?
- Stage your changes: Use git add to stage the files you want to commit. You can stage individual files or directories. -
-  Commit your changes: Once your changes are staged, commit them using git commit. This command records the changes to the repository along with a message describing the changes.
- Push your changes to GitHub: Finally, use git push to send your committed changes to GitHub. This command updates the remote repository with your changes.
   Replace origin with the name of your remote repository, and branch_name with the name of the branch you're pushing to (usually main or master).
  To push your local changes to the remote repository, in the repository bar, click Push origin. If there are commits on the remote branch that you don't have on your local branch, GitHub Desktop prompts you to fetch new commits from the remote. In the "New Commits on Remote" window, click Fetch.
